Hello!

My name is Ahmed, I've been working as a frontend engineer for more than three years and now I'm searching for a position that would allow me to grow as a professional, use the latest technologies and techniques.

I write semantic HTML5 markup, use CSS3 techniques for implementing complex responsive designs and animations, build pixel-perfect pages and use JavaScript with popular libraries to create fast, functional and dynamic applications.

In my workflow I use npm modules, git for version control, pug as a template engine, Stylus, SASS or LESS as style preprocessors, BEM methodology as a naming convention, React/Redux or Vue.js/Vuex as the main JS stack and Webpack for generating the final product.

You can find more info about me on my personal webpage: http://guseynov.github.io/

Best regards,
Ahmed Guseynov

Regarding my last projects: I left the company that only uses jQuery, simple styling and other rather outdated approaches. While being unemployed, I learned about Vue, Vuex, React, Redux and made several small projects for my personal site. You can see them in the React/Vue section, it's also quite easy to jump straight to the code: http://guseynov.github.io/
