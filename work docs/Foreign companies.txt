Hello!
I'm Ahmed, a frontend web developer and I found your listing on indeed.com. 

I've been working as a frontend developer for more than three years and I think that I meet the criteria you posted. 

Here's my website with all the necessary information about me, my experience and portfolio: https://guseynov.github.io

I can adjust my working hours so they match yours (my timezone is UTC +3). We can communicate the way that you prefer, I prefer videocalls. 

My salary expectations are 30000$ annually (15$ per hour), I'm looking for part-time to full-time employment (+30 hours a week).

Let me know if you are interested, looking forward to your reply.

Best Regards,
Ahmed Guseynov
