Hello!
I'm Ahmed, a frontend web developer from St. Petersburg, Russia. I'm searching for a remote position that would allow me to grow as a professional. I found your listing on weworkremotely.com and liked the description of the company and the position. I have 3+ years of working experience. I've been using React and Vue.js for a while now, you can see some of my personal React projects on my website: http://guseynov.github.io/

I'm available for 40 hours a week and can start immediately. My timezone is UTC +3, but I'm absolutely fine with adjusting my daily regimen to meet your requirements.

My salary expectations start from 1800 EUR per month.

Would love to hear back from you!

Best Regards,
Ahmed Guseynov
